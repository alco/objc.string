* benchmark all functions
* deal with different regex libs (NSRegularExpression, RegexKitLite, etc.)

* provide more efficient implementations for the following functions:
  - capitalize
  - chop
  - split
  - count

* reevaluate the importance of single-pointer invariant when chaining
  (possibly more efficient implementation of reverse)
